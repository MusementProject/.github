## üèõÔ∏è Application Architecture

Our high-level architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Client (Android)**: Native Android app uses Retrofit and Google Auth modules to send requests.
2. **Security Filter**: Validates incoming requests and passes authenticated calls to the server.
3. **Server**:

    * **Controllers**: Expose REST endpoints.
    * **Services**: Implement business logic (playlist parsing, recommendations, social features).
    * **Repositories**: Handle data persistence (Spring Data/Hibernate).
4. **Musement DB (PostgreSQL)**: Persists users, playlists, artists, events, tickets, and threads.
5. **External Services**:

    * **Spotify API**: Fetches user playlist data.
    * **Cloudinary**: Stores and serves user-uploaded media.
